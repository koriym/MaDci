> The Japanese have a small word - ma - for "that which
 is in between" - perhaps the nearest English equivalent is "interstitial".
 The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its
 modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and
 behaviors should be.

## Object Identity

This library is made for testing purposes. It is NOT doing true DCI. It use a wrapper object (RolePlaer) to represent the Role. See more at [I found a library that claims to do DCI, how can I know that it does?](http://fulloo.info/doku.php?id=i_found_a_library_that_claims_to_do_dci_how_can_i_know_that_it_does) for details.
